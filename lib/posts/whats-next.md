Hello again,

I started Python programming in summer 2020, with [AoPS's Introduction to Python Course](https://artofproblemsolving.com/school/course/python1). I learned basic things like variables, functions, data types, etc. A year later, I messed around with the Tkinter library and OOP. I made a [GUI PY to EXE convertor](https://github.com/cubingsoda/py-to-exe). A few months after that, I learned the core concepts of HTML, CSS, and JS. That's when I made the first version of my personal website. I also made a few userscripts and CSS for AoPS Blogs. In November 2021, I learned React.js and Next.js sometime. I saw how useful frameworks are, compared to vanilla JS. Finally, I looked at iOS/Android development a few weeks ago, but it costs money. I don't think paying 99$ a year to maintain an iOS app is worth it (where I am at right now). Even deploying a Chrome extension costs 5$.

So what should I do? Learn a new framework or a language? Email it to me at <cubingsoda@gmail.com>.
