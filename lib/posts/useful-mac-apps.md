I have used macOS Monterey for about a month or two on my hackintosh, and 2 months on my M2 MacBook Air. During those times, I found some apps that help me achieve things faster.

# Alfred

When I was using Windows, I pressed the Windows key to launch apps/documents. Soon after, I switched to PowerToys Run, which gave more options on what it can do. However, for some reason it was lagging quite terribly on my machine. When I run it, it took about 1-2 seconds for the menu to popup.

When I switched to macOS, I used Spotlight search (which was miles ahead of PT run) until I found Alfred -- It's basically Spotlight on steroids.

It not only does the great things Spotlight provides, but with extra features like opening websites with a shortcut. I also like the themes they give, and it's much easier to navigate (in my opinion) than Spotlight.

# Espanso

This app saves snippets via shorthands. For example, I can type `:br` to have it write

```

They also have a [hub](https://hub.espanso.org) for downloading user-made snippets.

# HotKey

Opening apps with Alfred is fast, but a faster method is using keyboard shortcuts. I use it mainly to launch the browser, music, and calendar.

# AltTab / Rectangle

Alt tab brings the useful feature from Windows to Mac. I have it configured so pressing `⌘`-`tab` shows the windows from the apps on the focused monitor, and `⌥`-`tab` shows the windows from the focused app (confusing I know).

Rectangle is a free and open-source window manager for Mac. I mainly use their keyboard shortcuts for full screening a window/moving apps from one screen to another.
