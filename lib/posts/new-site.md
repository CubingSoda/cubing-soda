Hello, this is my new website. I started web development in May 2021, when [Andrew Chen](https://github.com/actiniumn404) invited me to make a web-based AMC 8 Problem Generator. We also invited [SealsRock12](https://github.com/sealsrock12) and [Nhv24](https://github.com/nhv24). That's around the time I made my personal website, using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using bad practices such as using `<br />` for margining, maniculating the DOM with `.innerHTML` (at least use `innerText`), etc. I learned React in October 2021, and had fun with it. I also looked at Svelte and loved the simplicity. However, I learned React because it was the most popular (just to start off). In December, I started working on a programming quiz with SealsRock12, which is released [here](/projects).

I am using Next.js for this site, with my own SCSS styles. The navbar is inspired by [Next.js's navbar](https://nextjs.org/), and the posts page is inspired by [Web Dev Simplified's Blog](https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/).

Suggestions are appreciated.
