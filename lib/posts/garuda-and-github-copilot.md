Sorry for not posting in awhile, I am back.

A few days after installing Manjaro, I found [this site](https://manjarno.snorlax.sh/). I didn't think too much of it, until I saw system glitches here and there. I had to restart my computer around 3 times in total (less stable than Windows 11). I was about to build an Arch system from scratch, but that looked too hard for me. I found [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org/), and saw the cool UI. I installed it onto another partition, but ended up changing the shell, application, icon, and cursor themes. I have to say, it looks really good.

Here are some screenshots:

I also installed Microsoft Edge, because I liked the idea vertical tabs. However, I still like Chrome because of the integration with Google's services.

I got an email from GitHub about the copilot technical preview. The code suggestions sped up my workflow by a bit, but it uses `var` instead of `let` or `const` for some reason.
