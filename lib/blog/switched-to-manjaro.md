The laptop I have right now (HP Pavilion x360) had Windows 10 preinstalled, and I used it up until the summer of 2021. That's when I installed Ubuntu using a flash drive. I thought it looked ugly (I didn't know how to customize it at that time), so I switched back to Windows a month later. In November, I got interested in macOS. It looked clean, had a UNIX shell, and had support for iMessage/SMS/FaceTime. I went through [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/), and after a few attempts, I got it working. However, connecting it to an external monitor was unsettling, Bluetooth didn't work, the WiFi sometimes disconnected, and the webcam didn't work. Everything else felt fine. However, since OpenCore is relatively new, it lagged a lot, and crashed apps several times.

That's why I installed Manjaro, GNOME edition. It took me 2 hours to customize it and make it my own, so I hope I can stay on it as long as possible.
